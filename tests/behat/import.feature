  Scenario: import Random select answers questions
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question import" page logged in as teacher
    And I set the field "id_format_xml" to "1"
    And I upload "question/type/answersselect/tests/fixtures/testquestion.moodle.xml" file to "Import" filemanager

    And I should see "1. Which of these animals are mammals?"
    And I press "Continue"
    And I should see "Random select answers 001"
